<h1>Black hole</h1>
<hr>                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light and other electromagnetic waves,   <img src="20190410-78m-800x466 (1).png" height="95"align="right"></img>
Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These objects aren’t really holes. They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – can escape. The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s. It’s a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black hole.

There is much we don’t know about black holes, like what matter looks like inside their event horizons. However, there is a lot that scientists do know about black holes.
 <h1>Who discovered Black Holes?</h1>
  <p>The idea of black holes was first proposed by John Michell, an English clergyman and astronomical pioneer, in 1783. Michell's calculations suggested that a star with a diameter 500 times larger than the Sun and a surface escape velocity faster than light would form a black hole. He also noted that these massive, non-radiating bodies could be detected by their gravitational effects on nearby objects.</p>
  <p>However, Michell's ideas were not well known until more than a century later. The first object widely accepted as a black hole was Cygnus X-1, discovered in 1971 by Paul Murdin, Louise Webster, and Thomas Bolton. The discovery was made using a rocket launched to the edge of space in 1964.</p> 
  <p>The term "black hole" was coined by astrophysicist John Wheeler six decades after Einstein's theory of general relativity first described the characteristics of these objects </p>
  <p> In 2019, astronomers captured the first image of a black hole using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The EHT is a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes that captured the image of a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy M87.</p>
 
 <h1>Black Holes first discovery</h1>
 <p>The first object discovered widely accepted as a black hole is known as Cygnus X-1, a discovery made by Paul Murdin and Louise Webster in 1971. As its name suggests, it's an X-ray source in the constellation of Cygnus.</p><img src="black-holes-discovered-hero.webp" height="100"width="200"align="right"align="up"></img>

 <h1>People also ask:
 </h1>
 <hr>
 <h3>who is the father of Black Holes?
 </h3>
 <hr>
 But the true “father” of the black hole concept was a humble 18th century English rector named John Michell–a man so far ahead of his scientific contemporaries that his ideas languished in obscurity, until they were re-invented more than a century later
 <hr>
 <h3>What is exactly inside a black hole</h3>
 <hr>
 Black holes have two parts. There is the event horizon, which you can think of as the surface, though it's simply the point where the gravity gets too strong for anything to escape. And then, at the center, is the singularity. That's the word we use to describe a point that is infinitely small and infinitely dense.
